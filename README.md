# Bamazon

Bamazon is a node.js application that allows users to interact with a MySQL database using the command line interface.

## How to use Bamazon:

1. Once you are within the bamazon directory, type `npm install` to download all necessary packages. (See below for required packages)
2. The application requires the use of a SQL database. Once you have successfully connected to your database, paste the code from `bamazon.sql` to initiate your bamazon database and associated table.
3. After completing the above step, you will choose between two files, `bamazonCustomer.js` and `bamazonManager.js` depending upon the functionality you desire. This can be accomplished by typing `node bamazonCustomer.js` or `node bamazonManager.js`.
4. Make a selection from the options and follow the proceeding prompts.
5. Be amazed at how seemless node makes interacting with MySQL using JavaScript.
